I do computer system painting, modern art. I like the art of painting to be seen. Because permanence is to be seen, not to clean and without a viewer. 
My daily life today is painting and music. I don't know the future. But my paintings are systematic and painted, if they are seen, they will last. If they are not seen, they may be deleted after a while. Because what we know about the computer system, is to save or copying and printing. If we are indifferent. Gradually, over time, by updating and reaching newer styles, it is possible to clean the art painting for sure by every person who enters the system. The cleaner could be me or someone else visiting the system.
Thank you

There seems to be an opportunity for exaggeration, which I like to exaggerate.
Art should be in the hands of people who are artists themselves. and deal with art and artists.
and have an artistic life. Therefore, the interaction is an artistic communication between artists. that ordinary people, and some marginal readers, look at that artistic thing only from a personal and not an artistic aspect. They pick up. and pour analysis. But an artist who conceptualizes art. follows Not only does he understand the concept, but he can cleverly and intelligently contribute to his idea and creativity. And they understand the real value of art and stone.
You see. Some people look and follow with temperament and politeness, without realizing the concept from the artistic point of view, they are receivers.
The concept of art, the work of art with following artists in many received concepts can be better analyzed in terms of artistic style from the point of view of the common people.
